# SmartChit-Unfold2024

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Ethereum smart contracts** for the backend, utilizing **thirdweb** for interaction with the blockchain. The application simulates a traditional chit fund system, where users can create and participate in chits (groups), contribute a fixed amount, and receive payouts based on participation. 

### Features:
- **Create Chits**: Users can create a new chit fund by specifying the amount, number of participants, and the initial installment.
- **Join Chits**: Users can join existing chits by contributing to the fund.
- **Track Participation**: Users can see their participation status in different chits, whether they are a creator or participant.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Interactions such as joining a chit and making payments are done via Base smart contracts.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is built to be responsive and functional across multiple devices.
